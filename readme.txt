For lab 9, our CS5543 class investigated the usage of some machine learning algorithms using images. 
Our group used 5 images each from ambulation, nutrition, and knees for training because these are all categories relevant
to our NurseToGo application. The SocketClient connection can be used along with our existing TTS and STT code in order
to communicate output to the user.
